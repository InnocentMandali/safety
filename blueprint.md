# EmergenSync Blueprint

## Overview

EmergenSync is a personal safety application that allows users to send emergency alerts with their location to predefined contacts. The app also includes an admin dashboard to monitor all alerts in real time.

## Features

- **User Authentication:** Users can sign up and sign in using their email and password.
- **Panic Button:** A prominent panic button on the home screen allows users to send an emergency SMS with their current location.
- **Shake to Alert:** Users can also trigger an alert by shaking their phone.
- **Admin Dashboard:** A real-time dashboard for administrators to monitor all incoming alerts.
- **Settings:** A settings screen where users can change the app's theme and log out.

## Style and Design

- **Theme:** The app uses a modern, Material 3 design with a custom color scheme based on a deep purple seed color. It supports both light and dark modes.
- **Typography:** The app uses the Oswald, Roboto, and Open Sans fonts from Google Fonts to create a clear and readable text hierarchy.
- **UI Components:** The app uses a variety of Material components, including buttons, app bars, and list tiles, all styled to match the app's theme.
- **Layout:** The layout is clean and intuitive, with a focus on ease of use, especially in emergency situations.

## Current Plan

- **Implement Emergency Contacts:** Allow users to add and manage a list of emergency contacts who will receive alerts.
- **Push Notifications:** Send push notifications to administrators when a new alert is triggered.
- **User Roles:** Implement a user role system to distinguish between regular users and administrators.
